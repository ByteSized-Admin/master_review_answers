# Solutions to the questions

# Question 1
for number in range(1, 11):
    print(number)

# Question 2
user_input = ""
while user_input.lower() != "stop":
    user_input = input("Enter something (type 'stop' to end): ")
    if user_input.lower() != "stop":
        print("You entered:", user_input)

# Question 3
for element in [3, 7, 2, 9]:
    print(element * 2)

# Question 4
#CHANGED

# Question 5
for number in range(1, 21):
    if number % 2 == 0:
        print(number)

# Debugging Section - Corrected code

# Question 6
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print("The count is:", count)
    count = count + 1

# Question 7
for i in range(1, 6):
    print(i)

# Question 8
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
for number in numbers:
    print(number * 2)

# Question 9
i = 0
while i <= 10:
    if i % 2 == 0:
        print("Even", i)
    i += 1

# Question 10
print("Enter numbers one at a time. Type 'done' to finish.")
total = 0
while True:
    entry = input()
    if entry.lower() == "done":
        break
    try:
        num = float(entry)
        total += num
    except ValueError:
        print("Please enter a valid number or 'done' to finish.")
print("The sum of the numbers entered is:", total)

# Note: For an interactive environment like this, the input-related code (Questions 2, 4, and 10) cannot be executed directly here.
# However, this script provides complete solutions and corrections for reference in teaching and grading.
