# Simple Python Syntax and Beginner Stuff 

`Question 3: Ask the user for a number. Print "Positive" if the number is greater than 0, "Negative" if it's less than 0, and "Zero" if it's 0.`

This question incorporates input, conditional logic, and output all in one, providing a comprehensive review of basic Python syntax.

---

`Question 4: Write a program that asks for a password. Set a predefined password and check if the user's input matches. If it does, print "Access granted."`

Focuses on variables, user input, and basic conditionals, which are fundamental concepts.

---

`Debugging Question 8: Provided code snippets with common syntax errors for students to identify and correct.`

Encourages critical thinking and understanding of Python syntax errors.

---

# Conditionals

`Question 1: Ask the user for their age and print whether they are a minor or an adult (18 and above are adults).`

Reinforces user input and introduces simple conditional logic.

---

`Question 3: Use a for loop to print the even numbers between 1 and 20.`

Although primarily about loops, it introduces conditional logic within loops, preparing students for more complex loop usage.

---

`Question 5: Create a simple calculator that can add, subtract, multiply, or divide based on user input.`

Integrates conditionals with user input and arithmetic operations, offering a practical application of conditionals.

---

# Loops


`Question 1: Use a for loop to print numbers from 1 to 10.`

Introduces the concept of iteration with a for loop, a foundational skill.

---

`Question 2: Use a while loop to ask the user for input and print it, until they type "stop".`

Demonstrates while loop usage and introduces the concept of loop control with user input.

---

`Question 5: Use a for loop to print the even numbers between 1 and 20.`

Offers practice with for loops and conditional logic to identify even numbers, reinforcing both concepts.

---

# Lists and Dictionaries

`Question 3: Use a loop to print each item in the "fruits" list.`

Combines lists with loops, showing how to iterate over and work with list data.

---

`Question 4: Create a dictionary named "fruit_colors" with keys as fruit names and values as colors (e.g., apple: red). Include at least three fruits.`

Introduces dictionaries, a crucial data structure for storing key-value pairs.

---

`Question 6: Use a loop to print each fruit and its color from the "fruit_colors" dictionary. Format the output as "The color of [fruit] is [color]."`

Demonstrates iterating over dictionaries and reinforces the concept of key-value access.

---

# Functions

`Task 2: Define a function named greet_person that takes a person's name as a parameter and prints a greeting message with their name.`

Introduces the concept of parameters in functions, a fundamental aspect of creating reusable code blocks.

---

`Task 3: Define a function that takes two numbers as parameters and returns their sum.`

Covers defining functions that return values, allowing for discussion on how functions can process data and produce output.

---

`Task 5: Write a function named max_number that takes two numbers and returns the larger of the two.`


Offers an opportunity to discuss conditional logic within functions and the concept of returning values based on conditions.
